--Objective :: 

Approaching Towards Accuracy Of Counting objects In An Image

--Description ::

It is a Tool/Script using which you can find out a perfect combination of : 

* Kernel size (width/height) 
* Threshold (used to produce binary image) , 
* Divisor and Multiplier for average contour size (to get lower and upper 
  bound for contour sizes to be taken into consideration)

Using this perfect combination we can approach towards accuracy of counting objects in an image.
